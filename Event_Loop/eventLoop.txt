first learn about stack how it works and it operations

//Blocking -- > when things are slow (doing time taking operation ex: running image Processing or running a loop 16k times)


synchronus --> to run line by line it goes other operation once the operation done top of the stack in js. 

if operation is on hold/processing it wont move from that operation and the application will shutdown

for that problem the solution is {"asynchrnous callbacks"}



eventLoop:

--> js sent o/p to stack once it's done it console the o/p and remove from stack.
--> once the callback o/p went to stack that's not available in browser it went to "WebApi's" tab and continue the application
--> after webapi sent the callbacck to queue and
--> here the event loop involve it takes the queue first o/p and checks wheather stack is empty or not if stacks empty it sends the queue first o/p to stack and runs once the stack o/p completes it removes from stack
